paper: 'Improving robustness of softmax corss-entropy loss via inference information'
Inference region which inspires us to involve a margin-like inference information to SCE, resulting in a novel inference-softmax cross entropy (I-SCE) loss, which is intuitively appealing and interpretable. The inference information is a guarantee to both the inter-class separability and the improved generalization to adversarial examples
