# Improving Indiscriminate Transferability of Adversarial Examples via Channel Translation-Invariant Attack

In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named as channel translation-invariant attack, which exploits the sensitivity of the models on both channel translation and spatial translation, improving the indiscriminate transferability of adversarial examples. We show that optimizing a single adversarial example from more translated examples would bring better attacking performance on both normal models and defense models. More importantly, an ensemble of multiple transformations is degraded to a simple and efficient operation on the original image, facilitating the computation of the perturbation.
